2. Downloading and instaling the necessary tools


First we're going to have a web browsr and then we're going to need some sort od code editor to be able to do all he work.

Now if you're on Windows machine it'll have Microsoft Edge. If you are on Linux machine then it will either come with Firfox or Google Chrome but either way what i would like us to do is to all on the same page with a browser. So to do that we're just going to go to our default browser wich in my case is Firefox and we're going  to go to Chrome Google going into this exercise.



Now weÂ¿re going to coe in Sublimetext.

This is a good one for giving us different tols that we need for CSS and thein you'll want to grab JS for HTML former.


You'll want to sall prettier code for matter and that'll kind of help formatting the JS code and HTML code as well.

Si if we get those four different extension installed ad all like i said all you do is click the install 


Pretier - Javascript formatter
Pretier - Standar Javscript formater
vsc-pretier-glimmr
Pretier for Haddibars
Pretier Fuge Standart

Pretier Now
Pretier - Code formateer


The main Structure is

Webpage
	CSS
		reset.css
		styles.css
	images
		hero.jpg
	js
		main.js
	index.html


In the process of saying that i just remembered that there's another extension i want you to get it's called Alive server.
